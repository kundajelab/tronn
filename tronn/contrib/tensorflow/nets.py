"""
To add a network:

please note that it must be a function that takes two args:

def nn(inputs, params):
    # stuff happens here

    return outputs, params

inputs and outputs are dictionaries of tensors.
params is a dictionary of options.

once defined, add to net_fns to be accessible on 
the command line to other functions
